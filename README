This project is a project to get Psuedo-Chroma Support for WoW.


Issues:
	WoW does not permit addons to write to files and such.
	WoW severely limits the amount of dynamic information you can get access from outside the game.
		- This is to prevent botting



Current Support:
	- Change static binding based on "current" class
		* Can adjust brightness
	- Change the background animation going
		* Can adjust brightness
		Animations:
		- None
		- Spectrum Cycling
	- Mouse On/Off (follows bg)

Future Support:
	- Allow a lot more customization options
		- What colors are associated with what classses
		- Change which bindings get changed
		- Secondary bindings and color management
	
	- Different background effects
		- Color wheel
		- Rainbow
		- Static
	
	- Add reactive lighting and color choice
	

Desired Support:
	- Interpret dynamic information to do cool affects
		Ex: Leftside of numpad Health bar, right side Power bar



Installation:

For now you have to build the project yourself (I'm using VS2015)

Then install the WoWAddon, by putting the folder "KenithalsChromaApp_WoWAddon" in your WoW/Interface/Addons/ folder.


Use:
Run the executable from building the release version of your choice.

Copy and paste the path to your WoW/WTF/<USERNAME>/SavedVariables/ into the text box labeled WoWAddon Path.
	- This is the file that the App will read to get the information it needs.

Login to your character with the Addon enabled. Reloadui and everything should be working!
